# Mission: Jebediah needs a ride

It was a sunny day on Kerbin when we received an emergency call from Jebediah Kerman, chief commander of the Ballantines Orbit Station: 
Fuel is running low. And even worse: the space toilet is clogged and we are out of booze. 
With other words: "Jebediah needs a ride!"
